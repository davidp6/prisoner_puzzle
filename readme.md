# Code that runs simulations for the prisoner puzzle that Roy shared with us.
-----

# Prompt: 

## The names of 100 prisoners are placed in 100 wooden boxes, one name to a box, and the boxes are lined up on a table in a room.
## One by one, the prisoners are led into the room; each may look in at most 50 boxes, but must leave the room exactly as he found it and is permitted no further communication with the others.
## The prisoners have a chance to plot their strategy in advance, and they are going to need it, because unless every single prisoner finds his own name all will subsequently be executed.
## Find a strategy for them which has probability of success exceeding 30%.
-----

# Code:
## SimulatePrisonerPuzzle.r 	: main code that runs everything else
## SimulateSampling.r			: function that executes multiple iterations of a given sampling strategy
## Random.r						: function that implements a completely random sampling strategy
-----

# Approach:
## Write different scripts in the style of Random.r that test out other strategies that the prisoners might take. See if they work.
